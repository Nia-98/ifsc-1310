     <p id=Nia>  The Last of us is an action-adventure videogame played from a third-person perspective. The US was ravaged by a deadly fungus in 2013. The infected humans were transformed into aggressive creatures. When Tommy and Joel escaped from Austin, Texas, Sarah, their daughter, was killed by a soldier as they tried to flee.
        After two decades, civilization collapsed due to the spread of the disease. The survivors live in isolated settlements, quarantine zones, and nomadic groups. Joel works as a smuggler for his partner, Annie Wersching, in Boston's North End. The leader of the Fireflies, named Marlene, promised to double their supplies in exchange for bringing a teenage girl named Ellie into the organization. When Ellie and her companions snuck out at night, they encounter a government patrol. Symptoms normally occur within two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks earlier and that her immunity may lead to a cure.
